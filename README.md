# Time evolution of quantum states


## Instruction

### Requirement

After executong the code, one should preinstall h5py, qiskit, qutip.

### processs


## Result

As the three jupyter notebooks show, the **U_(AVQDS)(\pi)** unitary has the best performance around $93.42 \pm 0.25$ percent fidelity. The 4 time repeated $U_{\text{AVQDS}}(\pi/4)$ also has $70.44 \pm 0.84$ percent fidelity. The 3-Cnot Heisenberg operator with 6 Trotter steps just has $57.05 \pm 0.8 $ percents fidelity. The result shows that the AVQDS unitary successfully minimize the Trotter errors so the AVQDS's result outperform the 3-CNOT Heisenberg operator's result.
