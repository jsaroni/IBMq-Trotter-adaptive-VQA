# Time evolution of quantum states


## Instruction

### Requirement

After executong the code, one should preinstall h5py, qiskit, qutip.

### Processs


## Result

As the three jupyter notebooks show, the **U_(AVQDS)(\pi)** unitary has the best performance around 93.42 percents fidelity. The 4 time repeated **U_(AVQDS)(\pi/4)** also has 70.44 percents fidelity. The 3-Cnot Heisenberg operator with 6 Trotter steps just has 57.05 percents fidelity. The result shows that the AVQDS unitary successfully minimize the Trotter errors so the AVQDS's result outperform the 3-CNOT Heisenberg operator's result.
